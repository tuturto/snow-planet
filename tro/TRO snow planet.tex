\section{Kuolimo}

\newthought{Kuolimo} is the third planet of Kiiminki system. It is also
called Kiiminki Prime, being the first planet settled in the system.
Kuolimo is the only planet in the system that is habitable for humans,
without special gear. The climate is cold, most of the planet is covered
in snow and ice, so some protective gear is still needed.

Kuolimo has four large continents and several clusters of islands. While
most of them are covered under ice, equatorial band is free of snow and
ice. In addition to that, areas of volcanic activity are warmer and have
less ice or are free of ice during summer months.

Climate around the equator is the most habitable, so settlements have
clustered on that area. Outposts, scientific compounds and some other
structures are located outside of the equator band, but they tend to
be rarer.

\section{Jalanti}

\newthought{Jalanti} is the fourth planet of Kiiminki system and one of
the few with settlement on it. The atmosphere of Jalanti is unbreathable
and temperature too cold for humans to survive without protective gear
or suitable vehicles. However, Jalanti has relatively rich deposits of
minerals that have attracted people to build small semi-permanent
settlement there. \marginnote{Internal combustion engines are not usable
at Jalanti, thus miners are using either fuel-cell or fusion reactor
powered vehicles.}

Jalanti Mining Station is small, mostly sub-surface, town. The exact
number of inhabitants depend on supply and demand of the minerals, but
is generally around 50 000. The mining station isn't fully
self-sufficient, but relies on materials sent from the Kiiminki Prime.

\section{Kuorinka}

\newthought{Kuorinka} is the ninth planet of Kiiminki system. It consists
mostly of ice and dust. Kuorinka is a little of interest for people of
Kiiminki system. At one time there were plans to set up a remote research
station there, but the plans never materialized. Kuorinka is inhospitable
place that does not offer any natural resources to exploited.

Few exploration missions have been sent to Kuorinka and all have failed
to produce information that could be directly beneficial to the people 
of Kiiminki system. Scientifically Kuorinka is interesting, because it
is so far from the center of the star system and temperature is rather
low.

\chapter{Fifty Words for Snow}

\newthought{People of Kiiminki system} had fifty words for snow and
J\o rdis hated each and every of them with burning passion. He hated
\emph{polanne}, solidified and partly frozen snow. He hated \emph{viti}, 
freshly snowed light snow. And especially he hated \emph{kinos}, snow 
that strong wind had pushed into dune shapes. In short, J\o rdis hated 
snow in general. The problem was, that in Kiiminki prime, snow was 
everywhere.

J\o rdis sighed and continued inspecting the Snow Moose, a huge
tracked transport that had been specifically designed for arctic
environment. If there was something that he hated more than snow, it
was having his vehicle to break down in the middle of nowhere, with
nothing else than snow around him.

Snow Moose was parked in a large hall with few other vehicles.
Floodlights provided light and he had turned vehicle's work lights on
too. Hall was almost warm, just a tad below freezing temperature.
There was no point letting snowy vehicles to warm so much that the
snow would melt and start rusting the steel. J\o rdis rubbed his hands
together briefly to warm them up and continued with the inspection.
Soon he would be done and hopefully Pettersson would be there to
join the ride to the outpost where they were to deliver some
supplies.

\newthought{Diesel engine} started to rumble as J\o rdis started the
engine and performed the final check up before unhooking the heating
cables and closing the engine hatch. Pettersson was late, but that was
nothing new. J\o rdis let the engine idle and listened to the sound.
Then he saw Pettersson finally enter from the side door and wave him
before starting to open the big double doors. Finally, they were about
to start their supply run to outpost 15.

J\o rdis turned on the headlights and slowly drove the Snow Moose out
into the darkness. It was early morning and the temperature was frisky
-25\celsius. J\o rdis dreamed of living on a sandy desert planet with
twin suns, as he waited for Pettersson to close the doors behind him 
and climb into the cabin. It was time to start the supply run.



\chapter{Military}
\label{ch:military}

\newthought{Military of Kiiminki} has always had to cope with the fact
that the system isn't not a industrial power house. They strive to
independence as much as possible, but the fact is that the military
is dependent on other systems for units and spare parts. Especially
BattleMechs can't be manufactured in the Kiiminki system.

\section{Organisation}
\label{sc:organisation}

\newthought{Military organisation} at Kiiminki Armed Forces (KAF) follow
to those of Star League to a certain degree. Commanders place a high
importance on self-reliance and independence of the fielded units.
Combined arms is favoured over single specific unit type.

\newthought{Divisions} are assembled as needed and their force
composition is tailored for the specific task in hand. However, some
standard force composition exists, that are often used as the base of
more specific force.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Standard Division Organisation}
\end{table}

\newthought{BattleMechs} are hard to obtain and maintain, so they are
rarely fielded in big numbers. Usually they are tasked to serve as a
strike force, while receiving support from armors and mechanised
infantry. BattleMechs are used to strike through the enemy lines and
mechanised infantry with the help of armors exploit the opening.

\bigskip
\begin{table}
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
Unit & Component Units & Total Strength \\

Regiment  & 3 Battalions & 108 BattleMechs \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Standard BattleMech Organisation}
\end{table}

\newthought{AeroSpace units} are sort of an exception in the KAF. 
\marginnote{Maintainen has long been a proving ground for AeroSpace
pilots and the place to earn pilot wings.}
They rarely get fielded in big numbers, except when no other unit can
fulfill the mission. Most often AeroSpace units are used to provide air
cover, obtain air supremacy and conduct recon and strike missions. They
are the surgical knife that a skilled commander uses to carve the battle
theater to his liking.

\bigskip
\begin{table}
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
Unit & Component Units & Total Strength \\
\midrule
Lance    & -           & 2 AeroSpace Fighters \\

Regiment & 3 Wing      & 54 AeroSpace Fighters \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Standard AeroSpace Organisation}
\end{table}

\newthought{Armor forces} are the bread and butter of KAF. 
\marginnote{There is a long standing tradition that at least two armor
companies are conducting arctic training at any given time. These
assignments usually last few months, during which the unit is operating
in the arctic region of Kiiminki Prime.}
They are used for everything from scouting to strike missions and recon 
with force. Arctic conditions of Kiiminki require specialized vehicles 
and crews that understand how to fight in the freezing coldness.

Armored units are able to operate in conditions that would be too cold
for regular infantry. They are not hampered by snow storms in the same
way as AeroSpace assets are. BattleMechs are even more versatile than
armor units, but much more expensive and rarer.

\bigskip
\begin{table}
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
Unit & Component Units & Total Strength \\
\midrule
Lance     & -            & 4 Vehicles \\
Company   & 3 Lances     & 12 Vehicles \\
Battalion & 3 Companies  & 36 Vehicles \\
Regiment  & 3 Battalions & 108 Vehicles \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Standard Armor Organisation}
\end{table}

\newthought{Mechanized and regular infantry} both use similar force
compositions. The main difference is that the mechanized infantry has
armoured personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles at their
disposal at all times. Use of regular infantry tends to concentrate on
defending cities and other structures, albeit some special units can be
used in offensive purposes too.
\marginnote{Arctic Foxes is foot infantry battalion that has specialized in
fighting in arctic environment without direct support. They are masters
of survival and considered as one of the elite forces of the KFA.}

Mechanized infantry is able to move quicker than the regular infantry
and their vehicles also provide cover from the elements. Close
co-operation with armor units is often trained.

\section{Military Branches}
\label{sc:military_branches}

\newthought{Kiiminki Armed Forces} have several branches, each with their own
specilized task and mission. Each branch is lead by Captain-General.

\newthought{Army} is the boots on the ground. It consists mainly of infantry,
armor and artillery. Some of the units have organic AeroSpace component
attached to them, but army otherwise does not have any major AeroSpace
capability. Army is currently lead by Captain-General xx yy.

\newthought{'Mech Force} mainly consists of BattleMechs, but IndustrialMechs
are used in certain support roles too. In addition to that, 'Mech Force has
some amount of mechanized infantry in them. 'Mech Force is one of the most
versatile branches and are capable of operating in very varied environments.

\newthought{AeroSpace Force} operate on and around the planets with AeroSpace
fighters. It primarily conducts AeroSpace warfare, but is also responsible for
patrolling and maintaining control in inner Kiiminki system.

\newthought{Navy} operates in deep space with warships, dropships and
jumpships. Navy performs patrol in the outer Kiiminki system and is tasked
transporting other branches from planet to planet or from system to system
when needed.

Navy works in close cooperation with the merchant fleet and collects
intelligence from them. In return, navy can provide escort for high profile
or otherwise important missions of merchant fleet.

\newthought{Intelligence} continuously gathers data from various sources,
analyzes it and provides summaries and reports when needed. While other
branches may employ recon forces on a tactical scale, intelligence has much
broader scope.

\newthought{Medical Corps} provides medical care to other branches. It trains
medics, nurses, doctors and other medical personnel. In addition to that,
Medical Corps performs research and development in medical field.

Combat medics of other branches are trained by Medical Corps and they may
return for additional training from time to time.

\section{1st Arctic Strikers}
\label{sc:arctic_strikers}

\newthought{1st Arctic Strikers} is a venerated elite unit.

\newthought{Commander of the 1st Arctic Strikers} is General Mari Lundgren.
She is proud to serve as the commander of such a venerated unit and is
commited to keeping it very effective. Especially the 3rd Arctic
Foxes have flourished under her command.

\subsection{Tactics}

\newthought{Out of all infantry units}, 1st Arctic Strikers is probably the
most capable of arctic warfare. Instead of waiting in cover, they prefer to
take fight to the enemy and strike first. 1st Arctic Strikers have often
attacked when the weather was worst and forced enemy to take cover.

\newthought{Commander of the 3rd Stompers} is general \O yvind Nordskov, who
has rather traditional view on the role of his unit. On his opinion,
BattleMech are the primary unit in battles and all other units are there to
support them. His views have caused clashes with other commanders more than
once. However, he is very skilled commander and can utilize strengths of his
unit very well.

\subsection{Tactics}

\newthought{General Nordskov} prefers to take advantage of good mobility of

\newthought{Support vehicles} form an essential part of any planet's
backbone. They might not be as flashy as machines of war, but without
them a planet would be in trouble.

This section will detail some new support vehicles that have been
designed specifically to work in the arctic environment.



\section{Snow Mover}
\newthought{Snow Mover} is a cheap and simple truck aimed for snow clearing and
removal. Two man crew is needed to effectively manage clearing equipment
and large searchlights mounted on the roof of the truck.

Snow Mover is the first dedicated snow clearing equipment by Drago ltd. As
such, it was based on very primitive technology as the goal was to build
cheap, sturdy and easy to maintain vehicle.

The vehicle didn't gain very widespread adoption. Partly because the very
specialized niche and partly because it was pretty terrible in clearing
snow. Wheeled design tended to get stuck in snow and it suffered from
other malfunctions too\marginnote{The engine was notoriously slow to accelerate 
and would use disproportionate amounts of gas when driven at full speed.
On top of that, Snow Mover lacks even the most basic armour, making it
vulnerable to accidents.}.

\section{Tracked Snow Mover}
\newthought{Not satisfied} with the original Snow Mover, Drago Ltd set to design an
improved version. The new version used tracks and was specifically
designed for snow operations. Using the easy to maintain diesel power
plant meant that the vehicle was slower than before, with a top speed
of 54 km/h\marginnote{Originally engineers wanted to have the vehicle to have
a top speed of 64.8 km/h, but that simply wasn't possible with the chosen
engine type.} and was burning through fuel at a high rate when driven at top
speed.

Tracked snow mover was fitted with half a ton of BAR 4 armour, that would
protect it against accidental glances and falling debris. While not
originally designed to work as a bulldozer, tracked snow mover could be used
in such an operation too.
