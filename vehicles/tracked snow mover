Description:
    Not satisfied with the original Snow Mover, Drago Ltd set to design an
    improved version. The new version used tracks and was specifically
    designed for snow operations. Using the easy to maintain diesel power
    plant meant that the vehicle was slower than before, with a top speed
    of 54 km/h and was burning through fuel at a high rate when driven at top
    speed.
    
    Tracked snow mover was fitted with half a ton of BAR 4 armour, that would
    protect it against accidental glances and falling debris. While not
    originally designed to work as a bulldozer, tracked snow mover could be used
    in such an operation too.

Armament and Capabilities:
    Bulldozer 2 tons, Front
    Dumper 50kg, backfacing
    Search light, Front
