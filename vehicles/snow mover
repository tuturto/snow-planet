Description:
    Snow mover is a cheap and simple truck aimed for snow clearing and
    removal. Two man crew is needed to effectively manage clearing equipment
    and large searchlights mounted on the roof of the truck.

    Snow Mover is the first dedicated snow clearing equipment by Drago ltd. As
    such, it was based on very primitive technology as the goal was to build
    cheap, sturdy and easy to maintain vehicle.

    The vehicle didn't gain very widespread adoption. Partly because the very
    specialized niche and partly because it was pretty terrible in clearing
    snow. Wheeled design tended to get stuck in snow and it suffered from
    other malfunctions too.

Armament and Capabilities:
    Bulldozer 2 tons, Front
    Dumper 50kg, backfacing
    2 Search lights, Front and Back (0.5 tons each)
